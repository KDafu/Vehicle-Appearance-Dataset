# Vehicle-Appearance-Dataset 
Our dataset can be applied to various tasks such as model recognition, angle detection, car appearance evaluation, scoring, and image generation.

Create a large-scale and multi-dimensional vehicle appearance datasets (VAD), with near 140000 images, which is merged by three datasets: MVVA, VAS and VAPIE. Multi-view vehicle appearance image dataset (MVVA) contains 2093 automobile models and 78590 images, with small samples in the aesthetic evaluation of vehicle appearance design; Vehicle appearance scoring data set (VAS) with 19610 images is collocted , cleaned and preprocessed online then labeled by the quantitative scoring and perceptual imagery evaluation of the two dimensions of users and experts; And vehicle appearance perceptual imagery evaluation dataset (VAPIE) with 40017 images based on the perspectives of the users and the experts is labeled from the image data. 
# Multi-View Vehicle Appearance Dataset (MAAV)
We build multi-view image dataset of vehicle appearance 50 (MVVA50) and multi-view image dataset of vehicle appearance 30 (MVVA30). 
In MVVA30, each car model is sampled evenly according to an interval of 12 degrees, containing a total of 30 images in every collection. In MVVA50, each car model is sampled evenly according to an interval of 7.2 degrees, containing a total of 50 images in every collection. 
In MVVA50, we divide it into five categories according to brand nationality: China brands, German brands, American brands, Japanese brands and other brands. We have 50 brands of cars. It contains a total of more than 39500 high-definition vehicle appearance multi-view pictures. 
MVVA30 can be split into two categories of sedan models (A-Class sedan, B-Class sedan, C-Class sedan, D-Class sedan) and SUV models (compact SUV, midsize SUV, mid-large SUV, full-size SUV) according to the vehicle class. It includes a total of 48 different vehicle brands, different brands are covered by different numbers of mainstream models at present.

# Vehicle Appearance Scoring Dataset (VAS)
Using the preprocessed vehicle appearance user scores and vehicle appearance expert scores to annotate the corresponding vehicle models in the vehicle appearance multi-view image dataset, the vehicle appearance user scores dataset and the vehicle appearance expert scores dataset are obtained, and the two datasets are integrated to create the vehicle appearance scoring dataset (VAS). The dataset is divided into two appearance sub-datasets: B-class sedan and midsize SUV. The dataset contains a total of 620 models, including more than 19610 images of vehicle appearance.

#  Vehicle Appearance Perceptual Imagery Evaluation Dataset (VAPIE)
The corresponding images in the database are annotated based on the user's perspective and the expert's perspective, using the preprocessed vocabulary. we obtain the user and expert semantic evaluation dataset of vehicle appearance. We integrated the two datasets to create the vehicle appearance perceptual imagery evaluation dataset. The dataset is divided into two appearance sub-datasets: B-class sedan and midsize SUV. The dataset contains a total of 1179 models, including more than 40017 images of vehicle appearance.

The dataset is tested in various state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, and it is verified that the dataset is reasonably distributed, of high quality.
