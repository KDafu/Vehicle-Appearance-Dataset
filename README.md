# Vehicle-Appearance-Dataset
Our dataset can be applied to various tasks such as model recognition, angle detection, car appearance evaluation, scoring, and image generation.

Create a large-scale and multi-dimensional vehicle appearance datasets (VAD), with near 140000 images, which is merged by three datasets: MVVA, VAS and VAPIE. Multi-view vehicle appearance image dataset (MVVA) contains 2093 automobile models and 78590 images, with small samples in the aesthetic evaluation of vehicle appearance design; Vehicle appearance scoring data set (VAS) with 19610 images is collocted , cleaned and preprocessed online then labeled by the quantitative scoring and perceptual imagery evaluation of the two dimensions of users and experts; And vehicle appearance perceptual imagery evaluation dataset (VAPIE) with 40017 images based on the perspectives of the users and the experts is labeled from the image data. 

The dataset is tested in various state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, and it is verified that the dataset is reasonably distributed, of high quality.
